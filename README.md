## Motivations <a name="motivations"></a>

This project is to save somewhere some templates that could be reusable for me and are not related to any R nor python functions.

## Project description <a name="description"></a>

Currently, this package contains a README template, and Rstudio themes in CSS.

## Visuals

Here is an example of the pastel_on_dark rstudio theme:
